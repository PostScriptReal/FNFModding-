# FNF Modding++
FNF Modding++ was a fork of BulbyVR's FNF ModdingPlus, a modding engine that aimed to make FNF modding easier and give users the ability to make mods without the need to modify the source code.

I forked the original after it was abandoned and continued to update and make improvements to the engine for another year or so.
# WARNING!
This project was the first time I worked with JavaScript, I was completely self-taught and as a result the engine may be unstable.

There may also be performance issues (one I noticed during development was that the game would temporarily freeze when pausing the game, causing some notes to be missed during gameplay). As a result of abandoning the project because of disinterest the engine will contain unfinished/buggy features.
