Hey! I decided to move songs to this folder. This is a feature present in many fnf modding engines, and even Fnf 0.2.8 (Week 7) (Don't know why M+ hadn't done the same).
If you still want to use the music folder, just bring over your files and make sure they're named (SONGNAME)_Inst.ogg and (SONGNAME)_Voices.ogg.
