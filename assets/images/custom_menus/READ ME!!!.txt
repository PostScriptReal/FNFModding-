THIS IS A NEW FEATURE ADDED IN MODDING++, HENCE WHY IT DOESN'T APPEAR IN THE TUTORIAL TEXT FILE.
THIS TEXT FILE EXPLAINS HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN CUSTOM MENUS (Use template-dark as a basis! (It's made for that purpose!!)).

To clarify, menu-packs are NOT related to ui-packs. Ui-packs change the hud during a song (For example, the arrows are part of the hud).
Menu packs changes the look of the in-game menus before you start a song, for example, the 'Press enter to begin' screen.
Anyhoo, here's how you can make your own menu-pack and use it in-game!

1. Copy template-dark and paste it in the custom_menus folder.
2. Name it to whatever you want (DON'T INCLUDE SPACES!!)
3. Make your menu assets and replace the files (PLS DON'T DELETE ANY FILES).
4. Go to assets/data and find menupacks.txt
5. Copy the name of your menu-pack and paste it to a new line in the file and save.
6. Start up the game, and navigate to the options menu.
7. Go down to the Custom Menu option and select your custom menu pack (Don't worry about restarting to fully apply all changes).
8. You're done!

BTW, if you want to remove the Custom Menus option from the options menu, open optionsMask.json and set "menus" to false.
(IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE DEFAULT WITHOUT BREAKING THE GAME, YOU HAVE TO MODIFY THE SOURCE CODE!)
