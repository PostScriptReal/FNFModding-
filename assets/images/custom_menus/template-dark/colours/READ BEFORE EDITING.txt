You're probably confused on what this folder is, this folder contains hex colour codes that's used by the game.
For some menus, it loads MenuDesat and sets the colour to a specified rgba value.
If you haven't got it yet, all these text files contains data for custom colours for these menus.
When selecting this menu-pack the game will instead load these text files when setting the BG colour.
If you want to edit these colours, google 'color picker' (or colour picker depending on where you live of course), and pick a colour and paste the hex value of said colour.
(For the extra 2 digits, leave them be! DONT CHANGE THEM!!)
